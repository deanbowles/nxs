  PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymers have important applications in industry and
  medicine. Because of the differing solubilities of PEO and PPO in water,
  these copolymers exhibit a rich phase behavior that is sensitive to polymer
  concentration, solvent ionic strength, temperature, and pressure. These phase
  changes occur by the self-assembly of the polymer chains into structures with
  characteristic length scales most appropriately measured in nanometers. Thus,
  small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is a probe uniquely well-suited to
  studying this phase behavior. In these experiments we will probe the effects
  of concentration and ionic strength on block copolymer self-assembly using
  solutions of 1,2, and 5 weight% Pluronics F108 triblock copolymer in D20 with
  varying concentrations of salt added, one series in which the anion is the
  same and the cation is varied, and another where the reverse is true. The
  size morphology, and aggregation number of the micellar structures will be
  extracted through nonlinear least-squares fitting of the scattering data to
  model functions.</blockquote>

  ionic liquids show great potential for mobile fuel cell applications. They
  possess appealing features such as almost negligible vapor pressure, the
  characteristic electrical conductivity of an ionic conductor, and a sizable
  temperature gap between the melting and decomposition points. The diffusion
  dynamics of protons in these complex liquids are closely tied to their
  performance as electrolytes. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) is a
  technique of choice for studying the details of diffusion dynamics of
  hydrogen because of (1) the large incoherent scattering cross-section of
  hydrogen compared to other elements and (2) capability of probing spatial
  characteristics of diffusion processes through dependence of the scattering
  signal on the momentum transfer, Q. The latter is a clear advantage of QENS
  compared to, for instance, NMR. In our QENS experiment to be performed on the
  new SNS backscattering spectrometer, BASIS, we will utilize the Q-dependence
  of the scattering signal to identify and analyze several dynamic processes
  involving diffusion motions of hydrogen atoms in a recently synthesized ionic
  liquid [H2NC(dma)2][BETI].
